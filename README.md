## Node + Docker Hello World, for Showing Good Defaults for Using Node.js in Docker

> This tries to be a "good defaults" example of starting to use Node.js in Docker for local development and shipping to production with basic bells, whistles, and best practices. Issues/PR welcome.

**Note** I have more advanced examples of Node.js Dockerfiles and Compose files in my [DockerCon 2019 talk and repo](https://github.com/BretFisher/dockercon19). I also have more about everything Docker and Node.js in my 8 hour video course [Docker for Node.js](https://www.bretfisher.com/node/). 

**Also Note**, I have other resources on [Docker and Kubernetes here](https://www.bretfisher.com/docker).

### Local Development Features

 - **Dev as close to prod as you can**. docker-compose builds a local development image that is just like production image except for the below dev-only features needed in image. Goal is to have dev env be as close to test and prod as possible while still giving all the nice tools to make you a happy dev.
 - **Prevent needing node/npm on host**. Installs `node_modules` outside app root in container so local development won't run into a problem of bind-mounting over it with local source code. This means it will run `npm install` once on container build and you don't need to run npm on host or on each docker run. It will re-run on build if you change `package.json`.
 - **One line startup**. Uses `docker-compose up` for single-line build and run of local development server.
 - **Edit locally while code runs in container**. docker-compose uses proper bind-mounts of host source code into container so you can edit locally while running code in Linux container.
 - **Use nodemon in container**. docker-compose uses nodemon for development for auto-restarting node in container when you change files on host.
 - **Enable debug from host to container**. opens the inspect port 9229 for using host-based debugging like chrome tools or VS Code. Nodemon enables `--inspect` by default in docker-compose.
 - **Provides VSCode debug configs and tasks for tests**. for Visual Studio Code fans, `.vscode` directory has the goods, thanks to @JPLemelin.
 - **Small image and quick re-builds**. `COPY` in `package.json` and run `npm install` **before** `COPY` in your source code. This saves big on build time and keep container lean.
 - **Bind-mount package.json**. This allows adding packages in realtime without rebuilding images. e.g. `dce node npm install --save <package name>` (dosn't work on all systems)


### Production-minded Features

 - **Use Docker build-in healthchecks**. uses Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` with `/healthz` route to help Docker know if your container is running properly (example always returns 200, but you get the idea).
 - **Proper NODE_ENV use**. Defaults to `NODE_ENV=production` in Dockerfile and overrides to `development` in docker-compose for local dev.
 - **Don't add dev dependencies into production image**. Proper `NODE_ENV` use means dev dependencies won't be installed in container by default. Using docker-compose will build with them by default.
 - **Enables proper SIGTERM/SIGINT for graceful exit**. Defaults to `node index.js` rather then npm for allowing graceful shutdown of node. npm doesn't pass SIGTERM/SIGINT properly (you can't ctrl-c when running `docker run` in foreground). To get `node index.js` to graceful exit, extra signal-catching code is needed. The `Dockerfile` and `index.js` document the options and links to known issues.
 - **Run node in the container as `node` user, not `root`**. 
 - **Use docker-stack.yml example for Docker Swarm deployments**.


### Assumptions

 - You have Docker and Docker-Compose installed (Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, get.docker.com and manual Compose installed for Linux).
 - You want to use Docker for local development (i.e. never need to install node/npm on host) and have dev and prod Docker images be as close as possible.
 - You don't want to lose fidelity in your dev workflow. You want a easy environment setup, using local editors, node debug/inspect, local code repo, while node server runs in a container.
 - You use `docker-compose` for local development only (docker-compose was never intended to be a production deployment tool anyway).
 - The `docker-compose.yml` is not meant for `docker stack deploy` in Docker Swarm, it's meant for happy local development. Use `docker-stack.yml` for Swarm.

 
### Getting Started

If this was your Node.js app, to start local development you would:

 - Running `docker-compose up` is all you need. It will:
 - Build custom local image enabled for development (nodemon, `NODE_ENV=development`).
 - Start container from that image with ports 80 and 9229 open (on localhost).
 - Starts with `nodemon` to restart node on file change in host pwd.
 - Mounts the pwd to the app dir in container.
 - If you need other services like databases, just add to compose file and they'll be added to the custom Docker network for this app on `up`.
 - Compose should detect if you need to rebuild due to changed package.json or Dockerfile, but `docker-compose build` works for manually building.
 - Be sure to use `docker-compose down` to cleanup after your done dev'ing.

If you wanted to add a package while docker-compose was running your app:
 - `docker-compose exec node npm install --save <package name>`
 - This installs it inside the running container.
 - Nodemon will detect the change and restart.
 - `--save` will add it to the package.json for next `docker-compose build`

To execute the unit-tests, you would:
 - Execute `docker-compose exec node npm test`, It will:
 - Run a process `npm test` in the container node.
 - You can use the *vscode* to debug unit-tests with config `Docker Test (Attach 9230 --inspect)`, It will:
   - Start a debugging process in the container and wait-for-debugger, this is done by *vscode tasks*
   - It will also kill previous debugging process if existing.

### Ways to improve security

#### Run Node.js as Non-Root User

As mentioned in the official docker node image docs, Docker runs the image as root. This can pose a potential security issue.
  - https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/master/docs/BestPractices.md#non-root-user

As a security best practice, it is recommended for node apps to listen on non-privileged ports as mentioned here:
