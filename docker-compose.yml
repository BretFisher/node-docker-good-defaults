      # this is a workaround to prevent host node_modules from accidently getting mounted in container
      # in case you want to use node/npm both outside container for test/lint etc. and also inside container
      # this will overwrite the default node_modules dir in container so it won't conflict with our
      # /opt/node_modules location. Thanks to PR from @brnluiz
